I want to provide a few ideas to get your creative juices flowing, but _please_ don't choose a project from this list without at least putting your own spin on it

- A text-based adventure game in the terminal
- A CLI tool to detect the strength of a password, or to validate it
- Tic-Tac-Toe in a tkinter GUI
- A tool that creates ASCII art from an image
- A command line tool to view Reddit feeds in the terminal
- A command line tool that parses a CSV file of pokemon data and lets you search for pokemon by name, type, etc.
