# 🧩 Maze Solver in Python

Welcome to the Maze Solver project! This Python application generates a maze and then solves it using recursive backtracking. It offers a visual representation of both maze construction and traversal — perfect for practicing algorithms and working with graphical interfaces in Python.

---

## 📌 Features

- Procedural maze generation using recursive backtracking
- Visualized maze drawing with wall breaking animation
- Maze-solving visualization using DFS (recursive)
- Clean and modular object-oriented design
- Configurable grid size, cell size, and animation timing

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Tkinter** – for GUI and drawing
- **unittest** – for test coverage

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Installation

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/maze-solver.git
   cd maze-solver
   ```
````

2. **(Optional) Create a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

> 🔹 If you're only using standard Python libraries (like `tkinter`, `time`, `unittest`), you may not even need a `requirements.txt`.

## 🧪 Running the Maze Solver

### 🖼️ Launch the GUI

To run the maze generator and solver:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will open a window, generate the maze, and begin solving it step-by-step.

### ✅ Running Unit Tests

```bash
python tests.py
```

This will run the test suite located in `tests.py` and verify the maze is built and behaves as expected.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- The maze is built as a grid of `Cell` objects.
- Each cell has 4 walls and a `visited` status.
- The maze generation uses **Depth-First Search (DFS)** with backtracking to break down walls between cells.
- The solving algorithm retraces paths recursively until it reaches the goal.

## 💡 Ideas for Extension

While not required, if you enjoyed this project and want to extend it further for additional practice, here are some ideas:

- 🔁 Add other solving algorithms, like **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** or **A\***
- 🎨 Make the visuals prettier: change colors, shapes, or cell designs
- 🐢 Tweak animation speed: maybe slow down backtracking and speed up new path discovery?
- 🧰 Add an interface using **Tkinter buttons** to let users configure:

  - Maze size
  - Speed
  - Algorithm choice

- 🌐 Generate **larger** or even infinite mazes
- 🕹️ Turn it into a **game** where the user chooses directions to escape
- 🤖 Let the user **race against an algorithm** to solve the maze
- 🔲 Make a **3D maze** using layers or isometric projections
- ⏱️ Benchmark different algorithms to compare **efficiency and speed**

### ✅ Notes:
- Replace `your-username` in the Git clone URL with your actual GitHub username.
- If you don’t use external packages, you can remove the `pip install` and `requirements.txt` steps.
- Feel free to add a `main.py` example if you haven’t already — I can help generate one if you need.

Would you like help with a `main.py` file or `.gitignore` next?
